# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification on Iris Dataset

This Jupyter Notebook (`knn.ipynb`) demonstrates the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset, including dimensionality reduction, model evaluation, and decision boundary visualization.

## Contents

- **Data Loading:**  
  Loads the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.

- **Dimensionality Reduction:**  
  Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce features to 2D for visualization.

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Standardizes features using `StandardScaler`.

- **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
  - Splits data into training and test sets.
  - Trains
